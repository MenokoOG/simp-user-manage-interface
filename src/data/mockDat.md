This function creates an array of 100 user objects. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **`Array.from({ length: 100 }, ...)`:** 
   - This creates a new array with 100 elements. The `length: 100` specifies the number of elements in the array. The elements are initially undefined.
   - The second argument is a mapping function that will be called on each element in the array.

2. **`(_, index) => ...`:** 
   - The mapping function takes two arguments: the current element (which is `_` and is unused here) and the index of the element in the array.
   - The `index` starts at 0 and increments by 1 for each element in the array.

3. **`({ id: index + 1, name: \`User ${index + 1}\`, email: \`user${index + 1}@example.com\` })`:**
   - For each index, a new object is created with the following properties:
     - `id`: This is set to `index + 1`, giving each user a unique ID from 1 to 100.
     - `name`: This is a string in the format `User X`, where `X` is the current index + 1.
     - `email`: This is a string in the format `userX@example.com`, where `X` is the current index + 1.

The result is an array named `users` that contains 100 objects, each representing a user with an `id`, `name`, and `email`. Here's what the first few objects in the array would look like:

```javascript
[
  { id: 1, name: "User 1", email: "user1@example.com" },
  { id: 2, name: "User 2", email: "user2@example.com" },
  { id: 3, name: "User 3", email: "user3@example.com" },
  // ...
  { id: 100, name: "User 100", email: "user100@example.com" }
]
```
